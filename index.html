			 <h3>Day 1</h3>
			 <span>April 1, 2019</span>
			 <p>I am a software developer at a local company here in Fort Collins, Colorado. I am trying to get a better job in terms of work and salary. Its been more than 6 months and have not been successful yet.I did get interviews from MNCs like Amazon, Microsoft, F5Network etc and fortunately I was able to crack initial Interviews and go onsite. But I donâ€™t have any offers yet.</p>
			 <p> I am writing this blog/daily post to keep myself motivated and not to give up. I am taking up a #100DayJobHunt similar to #100DaysCoding. Everyday I want to apply for Jobs and work on coding problems/My side projects.</p>	
			 <p> Its really scary to share this on twitter/linkedin (Judgement zone)!</p>	
			 
			 <p><span>Progress</span> </p>
			 <p>Applied for jobs - productive <br /> Worked on my android side project - Not really productive <br /> Got this site up and running - productive </p>
